# Deep-Learning-small-projects

This includes some small projects I did during learning about deep learning.

1. Knn
2. Using Logistic regression on MINST and Cfar-10
3. Implementing Ada Optimizer using Tensorflow.
4. CNN
5. improved CNN, using different architecture, adding dropout, skip connection and batch normalization.
